# Laplacian2Art
This is a personal project of mine that involves converting laplacian of an image to art using a pix2pix GAN. This project is for educational purposes only.
The codebase in the repository is not final and hence is not very clean. At the present time this repository is only for experimenting with various architectures
and models.
